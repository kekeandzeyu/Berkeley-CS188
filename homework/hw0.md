## Q1 Probabilistic Inference

Your box of cereal may be a contest winner! It's rattling, which 100% of winner boxes do. Of course 1% of all boxes rattle and only one box in a million is a winner. What is the probability that your box is a winner?

Note on answer formatting: Please specify your answer as a decimal probability (i.e. .05 rather than 5%).  Do not include zeros before the decimal.  To receive credit, your answer must match ours exactly.

.0001

## Q2 Events

You are playing a solitaire game in which you are dealt three cards without replacement from a simplified deck of 10 cards (marked 1 through 10). You win if one of your cards is a 10 or if all of your cards are odd.

How many winning hands are there if different orders are different hands?

276

What is your chance of winning?  (round your answer to 3 decimal places). Do not include zeros before the decimal.

.383

## Q3 Expectations

Someone rolls a fair six-sided die and you win points equal to the number shown.

What is the expected number of points after one roll?

3.5

After 2 rolls?

7

After 100 rolls?

350

## Q4 Conditional Probabilities

Select all of the following statements that are true for all joint distributions over $X$ and $Y$.

$P(x,y)=P(x|y)P(y)$

$P(x)=\sum_y P(x,y)$

## Q5 Linear Equations

You know that $x=(\frac {1}{2})y + (\frac {1}{2})(x+1)$ and $y=(\frac {1}{3})+(\frac {1}{3})(x+2)$.

What is x?

4

What is y?

3

## Q6 Logarithms

Select all of the the following statements that are true.

$2^{(x+y)}=2^x2^y$

$\log(3^x)=x\log(3)$

## Q7 Hashing

### Q7.1

Which critical operation is generally faster in a hash table than in a linked list?

testing for the membership of an element in the data structure

(the question is a little equivocal)

### Q7.2

On average, how fast is this operation in a hash table?

$O(1)$

### Q7.3

On average, how fast is this operation in a linked list?

$O(n)$
